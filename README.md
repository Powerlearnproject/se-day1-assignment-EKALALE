#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

What is Software Engineering?

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software applications. It aims to create reliable, scalable, and maintainable software solutions that meet user requirements efficiently.

Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry

 .Enhances Efficiency: Ensures structured development, reducing time and cost.

 .Improves Software Quality: Uses methodologies to create secure and high-performing applications.

 .Facilitates Collaboration: Standardized approaches improve teamwork in development.

 .Supports Scalability: Enables building software that can grow with user needs.

  .Ensures Maintainability: Well-documented and structured code allows easier updates and bug fixes.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

   1.  1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering – First formal recognition of software engineering as a 
      discipline.

   2. Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s) – Provided a structured approach to software development.

   3. Agile Manifesto (2001) – Revolutionized software development by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, 
      and customer feedback.

   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Planning – Define objectives, feasibility analysis, and resource allocation.

Requirement Analysis – Gather and document software requirements.

Design – Create architecture and design specifications.

Implementation – Develop and code the software.

Testing – Validate the software through unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

Deployment – Release the software to users.

Maintenance – Provide updates, fix bugs, and enhance features over time.





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall has Sequential Approach while  Agile has iterative approach
waterfall has rigid and structured flexibility while Agile ha flexible and adaptive 
waterfall has minimal testing while Agile has continuous testing and feedback



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  . Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and fixes bugs.

  .  Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software, identifies defects, and ensures software meets quality 
    standards.

  .  Project Manager: Oversees project planning, timelines, and communication among team members and 
     stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  .  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers to 
     enhance development (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).

  .  Version Control Systems (VCS): Manage code changes, enable collaboration, and track history (e.g., Git, 
      GitHub, GitLab).




What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    .  Requirement Changes – Use Agile methodologies to accommodate evolving needs.

    .  Debugging Complex Code – Employ logging and debugging tools.

    .  Time Constraints – Prioritize tasks using project management techniques like Scrum.

    .  Security Threats – Implement secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
     Unit Testing – Tests individual components for correctness.

     Integration Testing – Ensures modules work together as expected.

     System Testing – Verifies the entire system meets requirements.

     Acceptance Testing – Confirms software meets end-user expectations before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    What is Prompt Engineering?

       Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in 
       generating desired responses. It enhances AI interactions by improving accuracy and relevance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Example of Improving a Prompt

1. Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."

2. Improved Prompt: "Provide a summary of World War II, focusing on key events between 1939 and 1945."

3. Why is the Improved Prompt Better?

4. Clarity – Specifies the topic (World War II).

5. Specificity – Narrows the focus to key events.

6. Conciseness – Eliminates ambiguity and ensures a relevant AI response.
